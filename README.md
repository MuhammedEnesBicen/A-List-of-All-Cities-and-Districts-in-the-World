# A List Of Cities and Districts of All Over the World

With this repo, I aimed to keep the list containing the names of all the settlements in the world as a series in a txt file and to present it in a way that those who need can use it directly. The main purpose of the array with the names of the settlements is that it can be used for auto-completion in any search process in applications such as maps or weather conditions. 

With these thoughts in mind, I created a new list by taking only the names of the settlements from the source you can access from this [link](https://github.com/lutangar/cities.json) on Github.

cities.txt(inside bin folder) contains <span style ="color:blue;">128769</span> places names.
